# What is this?

This is an overlay of [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/), including stuff I need but not available or outdated in other
overlays.

Unlike [lazychn](https://github.com/CHN-beta/lazychn), this overlay is prepared for other users, not just me.
I will try to keep packages here up to date and fix any issues as soon as possible.

# Why this name?

The word "touch fish" in Chinese "摸鱼" is a cute and playful way to express "slacking off" during working hours.
To "touch fish" does not mean you are a lazy or negative person, but means you are dissatisfied with the boring
mechanical work and involution between colleagues and trying on changing the situation.
Of course, it is impossible to create a better tomorrow without labor, but meaningless work also cannot.
It is good to do more work that is meaningful in your thought, and it is necessary to fulfill the boss's request.
But after that, just take a fish and touch it.

The word "os" is a short form of "operating system".
Currently, there are lots of so-called "os"s in China.
Most of them just beautify the user interface and add some extra pre-installed software and features, instead of
structuring from the kernel, system calls, c standard libraries, and so on.
In a nutshell, they are not doing something like Windows or GNU/Linux.
Of course, it is okay to call them "os", but when they advertise to the public, they keep their mouths shut about what
they are based on, and even imply to the public that they are a brand new os, especially those based on AOSP.
For example, the infamous "Harmony OS 2" was considered to be a brand new system and the pride of Chinese technology by
my parents and relatives, simply because that is what all the hype says.
I was worried about such a situation.

However, all of these are not the reason I name this overlay as "touchfish os". I use this name just for fun.
